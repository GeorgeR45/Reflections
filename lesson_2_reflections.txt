What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Git creates an empty repository in the directory in which git init was called
  but no commits are made automatically ie no files are added to the new 
  repository.
  
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?

- The staging area contains only the files that are deliberately added to it while the 
  working directory contains all the files that currently make up the project. It thus 
  provides the ability to control which files are contained in a particular commit.
  
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

- Use git diff to view the changes that have been made since the last commit and commit
  when the changes seem to add up to a logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?

- When a new version of a project is created, perhaps with different features and their is
  a need to keep the old version as well. Here a branch could be created enabling both 
  versions of the project to be kept and accessed as required.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

- By showing all the commits on each branch and where new branches begin the diagram 
  creates a map of the project history which makes it easier to navigate that history.
