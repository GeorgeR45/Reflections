What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Git creates an empty repository in the directory in which git init was called
  but no commits are made automatically ie no files are added to the new 
  repository.
  
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?

- The staging area contains only the files that are deliberately added to it while the 
  working directory contains all the files that currently make up the project. It thus 
  provides the ability to control which files are contained in a particular commit.
  
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

 - Use git diff to view the changes that have been made since the last commit and commit
   when the changes seem to add up to a logical change.
