When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- A remote repository would be used when a project is being worked on by more than one person
  or when it is desiredto make the project available to anyone who might want to use it or add
  their own changes to it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up to date with your remote repository?

- To retain control over which changes to the remote repository are added to the local 
  repository and when they are added.
