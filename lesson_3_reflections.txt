When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- A remote repository would be used when a project is being worked on by more than one person
  or when it is desiredto make the project available to anyone who might want to use it or add
  their own changes to it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up to date with your remote repository?

- To retain control over which changes to the remote repository are added to the local 
  repository and when they are added. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead
of another?

- A branch is a different version of a project that exists within a single repository, 
  perhaps in a different language or with an additional feature. A clone is a new copy of
  an existing repository. The existing repository that is cloned can be on the local 
  machine or on a remote host such as Github. A fork is a copy of an existing repository 
  on Github that allow a user to make changes to their own copy of the repository without 
  affecting the original repository.  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- It is possible for git to know if local changes have been made since the local repository
  was last updated from the remote repository so that any conflicts that arise when the 
  local and remote branches are merged can be automatically detected and appropriate action
  taken by the user to resolve the conflicts.
